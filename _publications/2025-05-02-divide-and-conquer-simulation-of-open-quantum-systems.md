excerpt: "We propose a divide-and-conquer strategy to prepare mixed states and combine the outputs of Kraus-operator dilations to simulate open-system dynamics on quantum hardware with reduced circuit depth, including a balanced grouping trade-off and a proof-of-concept simulation of the Fenna–Matthews–Olson dynamics."

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported - $$E=mc^2$$ - however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` which differs from the `$...$` that is typically expected.
