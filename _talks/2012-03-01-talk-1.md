In this talk we are going to explore a simple topology for the Open Quantum Walk model of Quantum
Computation. We will dive into some theoretical aspects of the evolution of the system that are important for
designing simulations and experiments, and present a circuit simulation model for this topology based on the
locality of the graph, which can be generalised to a certain class of topologies.
