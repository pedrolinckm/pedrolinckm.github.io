About me
======
I’m a PhD student in Physics at the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), based in Recife, Brazil. My work centers on **open quantum systems**, with an emphasis on **open quantum walks** and their connections to **thermodynamics** and **quantum computation**. I’m also interested in dissipative models of quantum information processing, and I teach undergraduate physics.

About this website
======
This website is a hub for my research and academic activities, all of which can be accessed from the top navigation bar.

- **Publications**: a curated list of my work, organized into **published papers**, **preprints**, and **in-preparation manuscripts**, each with links (PDF/arXiv/journal) when available.
- **Talks**: slides, abstracts, and (when available) recordings or materials from seminars, colloquia, and conference presentations.
- **Teaching**: course pages with syllabi, lecture notes, problem sets, and other resources for students.
- **CV**: a compact academic CV.
- **Quantum Recife**: the page of our local quantum group-sharing our research directions, study topics, meetings, and group activities.
